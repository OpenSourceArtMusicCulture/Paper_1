Students will break into groups of 4 to 5 with other students in their studio section. Students teams will then be assigned a FLOSS group or collective—these collectives will vary in their specific take on FLOSS, and will range from anything from an Open-Source software community to a feminist hacker collective. Student teams will then have to perform a social scientific analysis of that group, through investigation of that group’s produced media, conversation among group members online, and through interviews with group members.  Through these various data sources, students will then interpret and answer the following questions, **through the use of peer-reviewed sources (minimum count of 10):** 
* What are the groups’ goals? How do they aim to achieve them?
* How does that group disseminate knowledge—both ingroup and outgroup?
* How does that group communicate with one another?
* How does that group communicate with the outside world?
* How is group membership obtained? How is it maintained?
* What is the organization structure of the group? Who decides what projects get worked on? Are they largely individual projects, or collective projects?
* What materials are involved in the group production of knowledge (note: software also counts as material.  Also be sure to go beyond the constructed object when thinking about what materials are used).
* What roles do the group members say gender, race, and political orientation play in group dynamics? What are the difference between the way groups talk about themselves, and they way they act?
* How are they like FLOSS groups that seem to construct themselves around similar issues (i.e., other OSS privacy groups, other Feminist collectives)?  You should use peer-reviewed research to find information on other groups.
